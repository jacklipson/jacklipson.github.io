    <p>Today we talked about Newton polygons (which are referenced more generally in Neukirch II.6).</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "motivation">
    Consider a non-Archimedean CVF $(K, \norm \cdot)$ and some monic $f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \in K[x]$ with $f(x) = \prod_1^n (x - \alpha_i) \in L[x]$ for $L/K$ finite.
<p>We take a (possibly non-discrete, i.e. taking on more than $\Z$-values) additive valuation $\nu$ corresponding to $\norm \cdot$.</p>
<p>Recall that there is a unique extension to $L$ which restricts to $K$ of $\norm \cdot$ so we get a unique $\nu$ on $L$ also.</p>
<p>Today's question is as follows:</p>
<p><div class = "subthm-box" type = "question">
Is there a unique recipe to get $\nu(\alpha_i)$ from $f$?
</div></p>
<p>And the answer:</p>
<p><div class = "subthm-box" type = "answer">
Newton polygons.
</div></p>
</div>
<p>We can assume $a_0 \neq 0$ simply by dividing $f$ by powers of $x$. This is not at all harmful because our goal is to find $\nu(\alpha_i)$ and $0$ is not a very interesting root...</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "def" name = "Newton polygon">
    First define the finite set of points $S_f \coloneq \{(0, \nu(a_0)), \ldots, (n, \overbrace{\nu(a_0)}^{0})\}$. If any $a_i = 0$ such that $\nu(0) = +\infty$, just omit them from $S_f$ (it's clear this will have no impact later).
<p>We define the <u>Newton polygon</u> $NP(f)$ of $f$ as the convex hull of $S_f$.</p>
<p>In particular, it's bottom boundary will be determined by the following properties: $$(1) \; S_f \text{ on or above } NP, \quad (2) \; \text{piecewise-linear with flex points only in $S_f$}, \quad (3) \; \text{the slope is increasing}.$$</p>
</div>
<p>The more specific answer to today's question is:</p>
<div class = "thm-box">
    Say the flex points on the bottom boundary occur at $n - n_1, n - (n_1 + n_2), \ldots, n - \sum_1^{r-1} n_i$ where $\sum_1^r n_r = 0$.
<p>Then we get slopes $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_r$ corresponding to $(n,0) \to (n-n_1, \nu(a_{n-n_1})) \to \cdots \to \nu(0, \nu(a_0))$.</p>
<p>As a multi-set, $$\{\nu(\alpha_i)\}_{1 \leq i \leq n} = \{\overbrace{\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_1}^{n_1 \text{ times}}, \ldots, \overbrace{\lambda_i, \ldots, \lambda_i}^{n_i \text{ times}}, \ldots, \overbrace{\lambda_r, \ldots, \lambda_r}^{n_r \text{ times}}\}.$$</p>
</div>
<p>Before, we prove this, here are some observations.</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "rmk">
    If $L/K$ is Galois, then $\nu$ of conjugates are exactly the same so $\nu(\alpha_i) = \nu(\alpha_j)$ will have the same slope if they are conjugates.
</div>
<p><i> Below is another case of Professor Shin's &quot;ex&quot; standing for both example and exercise...</i></p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "ex">
    Say $\nu(a_1), \ldots, \nu(a_{n-1}) \geq \nu(a_0) > 0$. Then the Newton polygon's base is a straight line from $(0, \nu(a_0)) \to (n,0)$. Thus, $\nu(\alpha_i) = \frac{\nu(a_0)}{n}$ for all $i = 1, \ldots, n$.
<p>Now say $\nu$ is a discrete valuation (so $\Z$-valued). If $\nu(a_0)$ is coprime to $n$, then apparently $f$ is inert and irreducible in $K[x]$. In fact, this turns out to be a version of Eisenstein's criterion.</p>
<p>Say $f$ is reducible, so it has a monic factor $g$ with $m = \deg g &lt; n$ made up of some $m$ roots we can relabel $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_m$. Since $\prod_1^m(x-\alpha_i) \in K[x]$, we know $\prod_1^m \alpha_i \in K$ so will have integer-valuation under $\nu$. But, $\nu(\prod_1^m \alpha_i) = m \nu(\alpha_1) = \frac{m}{n} \nu(a_0)$ and $\nu(a_0)$ is coprime to $n$ so either $m = 0$ or $m \geq n$ - contradiction.</p>
<p>Now we show $f$ is an Eisenstein polynomial. Since $\nu(a_1), \ldots, \nu(a_{n-1}) \geq \nu(a_0) &gt; 0$, these are positive integers so all $a_i \in \pp_\nu$.</p>
<p>As long as we show that $\nu(a_0) = 1$, we win... well....</p>
</div>
<p>Back to the proof.</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "proof">
    First off, we may assume all roots $\alpha_i \in K$.
<p>The idea of the proof relies on the fact that $\nu(x+y) \geq \min \{\nu(x), \nu(y)\}$ with equality if $\nu(x) \neq \nu(y)$.</p>
<p>Reorder the roots as $\alpha_{1'}, \ldots, \alpha_{n'}$ such that $$\lambda_{1'} = \nu(\alpha_{1'}) = \cdots = \nu(\alpha_{n_1'}) &lt; \lambda_{2'} = \nu(\alpha_{n_1' +1}) = \cdots &lt; \cdots \lambda_{r'} = \cdots = \nu(\alpha_{n'}).$$</p>
<p>Now, we draw the base of $NP'(f)$ by connecting $(n-i, \nu(\alpha_{1'} \cdots \alpha_{i'}))$. We want to show $NP' = NP$ as this means our two sets in the theorem are identical.</p>
<p>By construction, the slope is increasing so we don't need to check (3).</p>
<p>For (1), we want to show $NP'$ lies below $NP$. But by our ordering construction: $$\nu(a_{n-i}) = \nu((-1)^{i} \sum_{I \subset {1, \ldots, n}, \; |I| = i} \alpha_I) \geq \nu(\alpha_{1'} \cdots \alpha_{i'}).$$</p>
<p>For (2), we want to show the flex points of $NP'$ are precisely those of $NP$. These are exactly at $a_{n - n_{i'}}$. Thus: $$\nu(a_{n - n_{1'}}) = \nu((-1)^{i} \sum_{I \subset {1, \ldots, n}, \; |I| = i} \alpha_I) = \nu(\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{n_{1'}}) = n_{1'}\lambda_{1'}.$$</p>
<p>Notice that $\nu(a_{n-{n_1'+1}}) = \nu(\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{n_{1'}}\alpha_{n_{1'}+1}) = n_1'\lambda_1' + \lambda_2' &gt; (n_1'+1)\lambda_1'$ so $NP$ changed slope at $n_{1'}$, as did $NP'$. We can repeat these checks to finish.</p>
