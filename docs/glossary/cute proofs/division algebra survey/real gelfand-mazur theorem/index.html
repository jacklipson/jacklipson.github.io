    <p>the <b>real gelfand-mazur theorem</b> is a generalization of the <u><a href = "../complex gelfand-mazur theorem">complex gelfand-mazur theorem</a></u>.</p>
<p>this version says the following:</p>
<div class = "thm-box" name = "gelfand-mazur (real)">
    any real normed associative division algebra $A$ is isometrically isomorphic to one of $\R, \C, \H$.
</div>
<p>here's a refresher on normed division algebras:</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "def" name="associative algebra">
    an <u>associaitve algebra</u> $A$ is a (possibly non-commutative nor unital) ring that is a module over a commutative ring (usually a field) $k$ such that $$c(xy) = (cx)y  = x(cy) \quad \text{for} \quad c \in k, \; x, y \in A.$$
</div>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "def" name = "normed algebra, division algebra">
    a <u>normed algebra</u> $(A, ||\cdot||)$ is an associative algebra over $\R$ or $\C$ with a norm such that: $$||xy|| \leq ||x|| \; ||y||.$$
<p>this submultiplicatitive property forces continuity of the algebra multiplication.</p>
<p>a <u>division algebra</u> $A$ is an associative algebra with $1_A$ such that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
</div>
<p>now let's reexamine what i said at the start.</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "rmk">
    the reason i call this version of gelfand-mazur a <i>generalization</i> of the complex version is because any complex normed division algebra is of course real, but the quaternions and reals are not complex algebras.
<p>this second part follows because if the quaternions were a complex algebra, then we would have a copy of $\C$ in $\H$. but by definition of associative algebra, $\C$ commutes with everything in $\H$ so $\C$ is in the center $\zz(\H)$. but this is absurd after a quick check: $$i(a+bi+cj+dk) = (a+bi+cj+dk)i \implies c = d = 0 \implies \zz(\H) \subseteq \R.$$</p>
</div>
<p>back to the proof of the real version:</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "background">
    apparently, mazur proved this result first but refused to oblige his publisher and shorten the proof so it was published sans any explanation.
<p>soon after though, gelfand released a full proof. i used his version as my primary reference (despite it only appearing online in <u><a href = "/assets/proof notes/gelfand normierte ringe.pdf" target = "_blank">german</a></u>...).</p>
<p><u><a href = "../gelfand normierte ringe eng-trans">here</a></u> is my sorry attempt at an english translation.</p>
</div>
<p>the proof requires a lot of groundwork which i give below.</p>
<p>under construction.</p>
