    <p>my final for functional analysis in spring 2025 was pretty boilerplate: 3 hours for 7 questions.</p>
<p>3 of the questions asked us to regurgitate parts of big proofs from class and 3 were easy exercises.</p>
<p>one piqued my interest, though.</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "question">
    take the usual banach space $V = C_\R[0,1]$. we know that $V$ is not reflexive because its unit ball has few extreme points. give a specific element of $V^{**}$ not in the natural inclusion of $V$. write no more than 2 not-long sentences justifying your answer.
</div>
<p>here's a little blurb explaining what this question means:</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "background">
<p>every undergraduate student of abstract linear algebra has it drilled into them that (for a finite-dimensional vector space $V$) the isomorphism $V \cong V^*$ is <b>NOT</b> canonical.</p>
<p>in other words, using Riesz representations or pairing up basis vectors with the dual basis depends, respectively, on the chosen inner product or the chosen basis.</p>
<p>however, the inclusion $V \to V^{**}: v \mapsto \text{ev}_v$ is canon (requires no choices).</p>
<p>it is very significant that this map always exists.</p>
<p>for starters, if this map is surjective (which always holds in the finite-dimensional case), $V$ is called <u>reflexive</u>.</p>
<p>somehow, professor marc rieffel, in the problem's introduction, was able to tell that this map wasn't reflexive without finding a vector not in the image (our job).</p>
<p>he did this by pairing up two theorems:</p>
<p><div class = "thm-box" name = "banach-alaoglu">
if $V$ is a normed vector space, then the closed unit ball of $V^*$ is compact under the weak-$*$ topology.
</div></p>
<p><div class = "thm-box" name = "krein-milman">
if $V$ is a hausdorff locallly convex topological vector space with a compact convex subset $C$, then $C$ is the closure of the convex hull of its extreme points.
</div></p>
<p>i am going to blackbox weak-$*$ topology to stay on track, but the point is that if $V$ was reflexive, the closed unit balls of $V$ and $V^{**}$ would be the same. and applying banach-alaoglu to $V^*$, we get that the closed unit ball of $V^{**}$ will be a compact convex subset of $V^{**}$ so by krein-milman it will be the closure of the convex hull of its points. but if the balls were the same, then the unit ball of $C_\R[0,1]$ should also be the closure of the convex hull of its extremes.</p>
<p>however, it has only two extreme points ($\pm 1$) (with respect to the suprememum norm) so the closed unit ball of $C_\R[0,1]$ is literally $[-1,1]$ but that is obviously false.</p>
<p>hence, $C_\R[0,1]$ is not reflexive so it is up to us to find an explicit vector in the double-dual which did not come from $V$.</p>
</div>
<p>here is the example i came up with:</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "proof">
    after a few minutes of staring blankly at the wall that i finally came to the realization that i had absolutely no clue what was in $V^{**}$ <i>besides</i> evaluations.
<p>but the only evaluations i could use were discontinuous ones.</p>
<p>great!... but i can't just pick any discontinuous function, the evaluation needs to actually exist and be continuous/bounded. but how do i find those?!</p>
<p>here was my <del>guess</del> idea.</p>
<p>define $f_n = \chi_{[0, \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n}]} + (-nx + \frac{n}{2})\chi_{[\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{2}]}$. of course $f_n \to f = \chi_{[0, \frac{1}{2}]}$.</p>
<p>put $\Phi(\psi) = \lim \psi(f_n)$. since $V^*$ is made up of bounded linear functionals, it's clear this is even worthwhile and that $\Phi$ is continuous since (if we assume existence) $$||\Phi(f_n)|| \leq ||\lim \psi(f_n)|| \leq \lim ||\psi(f_n)|| \leq \lim ||\psi|| \cancelto{1}{||f_n||_\infty} = ||\psi||.$$</p>
<p>here is how I showed existence:</p>
<p>for any $\psi \in V^*$, we can split it up as $\psi = \psi^+ - \psi^-$.</p>
<p>now, via the riesz-markov-kakutani representation theorem:</p>
<p><div class = "thm-box" name = "r-m-k representation">
given a locally compact hausdorff space $X$ and a positive linear functional $\psi$ on the compactly-supported complex-valued continuous functions $C_c(X)$, there exists a unique positive borel measure $\mu$ so that $$\psi(f) = \int_X f(x) d\mu(x), \quad \text{ for all } f \in C_c(X).$$
</div></p>
<p>$[0,1]$ and $\psi^\pm$ certainly fit the bill so we get two unique positive borel measures $\mu^\pm$ such that</p>
<p>$$\psi(f_n) = \int_X f_n d\mu^+ - \int_X f_n d\mu^-.$$</p>
<p>and since the $f_n$ are strictly increasing, we can apply the monotone convergence theorem:</p>
<p><div class = "thm-box" name = "mct">
given $\mu$-integrable functions $f_n: X \to \R$ for a measure space $(X, \mathcal{S}, \mu)$ such that $f_m(x) \geq f_n(x) \geq 0$ almost everywhere for any $m \geq n$, then $$\int_X f d\mu = \lim \int_X f_n d\mu.$$
</div></p>
<p>this implies that $$\Phi(\psi) = \lim \psi(f_n)  = \lim \int_X f_n d\mu^+ - \int_X f_n d\mu^- = \int_X f d(\mu^+ - \mu^-).$$</p>
<p>so it exists! and we are done.</p>
</div>
<p>my friend serkan salik came up with a different proof during the exam.</p>
<p>i present that here also:</p>
<div class = "subthm-box" type = "proof">
    define $\Phi(\text{ev}_{\frac{1}{n}}) = 1, \Phi(\text{ev}_0) = 0$ and extend this linearly over the span.
<p><i>(note that here, $\text{ev}$ is evaluating on points in $[0,1]$ whereas earlier in the page, i was evaluating on $C_\R[0,1]$)</i></p>
<p>clearly, $\Phi$ is bounded on this subspace so we can apply hahn-banach extension (different from the separation theorem):</p>
<p><div class = "thm-box" name = "hahn-banach extension">
given an $\R$-vector space $V$ and a minkowski gauge $p: V \to \R_{\geq 0}$, i.e. $$p(rv) = rp(v) \text{ for } r \in \R_{\geq 0} \quad \text{and} \quad p(v+w) \leq p(v) + p(w),$$
if a linear functional $\phi:W \to \R$ is subordinate to $p$ on $W$, then there is an extension $\tilde\phi: V \to \R$ subordinate to $p$.
</div></p>
<p>if we apply this to $p(v) = ||v||$, we get some $\tilde{\Phi}$ over $V^*$. notably, $\Phi(\text{ev}_{\frac{1}{n}}) = 1 \not\to \Phi(\text{ev}_{0}) = 0$.</p>
<p>but, if $\Phi = \text{ev}_f$ for some $f \in C_\R[0,1]$, then $f(\frac{1}{n}) \to f(0)$ since any $f$ is continuous.</p>
<p>this is a contradiction.</p>
<p>hence, $\Phi \neq \text{ev}_f$ for any $f \in V$ so $\Phi \in V^{**} - V$.</p>
