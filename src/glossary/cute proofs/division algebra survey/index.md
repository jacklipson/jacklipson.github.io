title: division algebra survey
---

below is a little survey of proofs classifying division algebras.

i think this topic is very confusing because there are many similar sounding theorems which mix and match words.

the words are as follows:

1. finite
2. finite-dimensional
3. associative
4. real or complex
5. normed
6. banach

every theorem here classifies division algebras paired up with some subset of the above words.

- <a href = "./wedderburn's little theorem">wedderburn: finite $\implies$ finite field</a>
- <a href = "./frobenius's theorem">frobenius: fin-dim + real + assoc. $\implies$ $\R, \C, \H$</a>
- <a href = "./hurwitz's theorem">hurwitz: fin-dim + real + normed $\implies$ $\R, \C, \H, \O$</a>
- <a href = "./complex gelfand-mazur theorem"> complex gelfand-mazur: complex + banach $\implies$ $\C$</a>
- <a href = "./real gelfand-mazur theorem">real gelfand-mazur: real + banach $\implies$ $\R, \C, \H$</a>
