the <b>real gelfand-mazur theorem</b> is a generalization of the <u><a href = "../complex gelfand-mazur theorem">complex gelfand-mazur theorem</a></u>.

this version says that any normed real division algebra is isometrically isomorphic to one of $\R, \C, \H$.

we first define such an algebra:

<div class = "subthm-box" type = "def" name = "normed algebra">
    a <u>normed algebra</u> is an associative algebra over ff
</div>
