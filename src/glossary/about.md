<div class="colorwave">hello, i am jack lipson.</div>

i am a senior at uc berkeley studying math and physics.

i am interested in functional analysis and want to learn more about number theory and Langlands program.

i love proofs that use one area of math to solve seemingly unrelated problems (e.g. Dirichlet's theorem).

i grew up in los angeles and newport beach, CA. 

right now, i am applying to math grad school.
